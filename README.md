# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-using-CNN
This project, "Brain Tumor Segmentation using CNN," implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automate the segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans. The model is trained on a dataset of brain images and aims to accurately distinguish tumor regions from healthy tissue. The repository includes the necessary scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and testing. It also provides sample images and results to demonstrate the model's effectiveness. This tool can assist in medical diagnosis by enhancing the accuracy and speed of tumor detection.
